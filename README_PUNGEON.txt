Welcome to the Pungeon, a den of meme sin.

For all you sneople (snake people (and/or snail people)), that's a snen of sneme snin.

This is a super simple Python game, the creation of which is taught by Kenneth Love at Treehouse. The version with a larger map and all of the terrible puns and memes, however, is entirely my own doing, and I'm (not) very sorry.

Verion 1.1
- Code has been cleaned up from its original raw state, all comments have been deleted and spacing has been checked over.

possible future updates:
- A bigger map, possibly maps of different shapes

- a RANDOMIZED map! picked randomly from a list of lists (making CELLS1, CELLS2, CELLS3, CELLS4 and then appending those lists of tuples to a list and randoming it at start)

- adding a loop to catch bad commands (ie, input that isn't a cardinal direction or the word "quit")
